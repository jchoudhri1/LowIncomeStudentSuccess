## R Codebook for College Scorecard Analysis


```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
data <- read_csv("Most-Recent-Cohorts-All-Data-Elements.csv")
```
We have about 1800 schools with over 1700 variables.

We are only interested in a few categorical and quantitative variables. Here's how we can slim down our dataset to only focus on our desired variables:
  - award bachelorâ€™s degrees
  - are not for-profit institutions
  - are currently operating.
  - are in the 50 states
```{r}
newData <- data %>%
  filter(PREDDEG == 3,
         CONTROL != 3,
         CURROPER == 1,
         ST_FIPS <= 56
         ) %>%
  select(school = INSTNM, institutionType = CONTROL, admit = ADM_RATE, med_income = MD_EARN_WNE_P10,
         med_fam_inc = MD_FAMINC, NPT4_PUB, NPT4_PRIV)
```
In order to properly evaluate our variables, we have to convert the quantitative variables to doubles instead of strings. 
```{r}
newData$NPT4_PUB <- as.double(newData$NPT4_PUB)
newData$NPT4_PRIV <- as.double(newData$NPT4_PRIV)
newData$med_income <- as.double(newData$med_income)
newData$med_fam_inc <- as.double(newData$med_fam_inc)
newData$admit <- as.double(newData$admit)
```
```{r}
newData <- newData %>%
  rowwise %>%
  mutate(cost = sum(NPT4_PUB, NPT4_PRIV, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(-c(NPT4_PUB, NPT4_PRIV))
newData["cost"][newData["cost"] == 0] <- NA
```
```{r}
head(newData)
```
A 1 for funding indicates a public school, while 2s indicate a private school. Admit is the rate of admission, med_earnings is the median income of a student following graduation, med_fam_inc is the students' family's median income, and price is the cost of attendance of the institution. 
```{r}
xdollar <- c(scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar,
                              breaks = seq(0, 130000, 25000),
                              limits = c(0, NA)))

ydollar <- c(scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar,
                                        breaks = seq(0, 130000, 25000),
                                        limits = c(0, NA)))

titling <- theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,
                                           face = "bold"),
                 axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
                 axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"))
```
