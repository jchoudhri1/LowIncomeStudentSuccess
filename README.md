# LowIncomeStudentSuccess
  One interesting question I postulated when looking at the US Department of Education's College Scorecard would be how a student’s median family income affect their median earnings following graduation, and how this may be impacted by the types of institutions they attend. For example, it would be interesting to see how lower income students fare post-graduation when attending a public school versus when attending a private school. There has been literature looking at the interactive relationship between family income and the college experience and how it’s affected their college experience, and it’d be interesting to see if some of the difficulties these students had affected their lives after graduation. Additionally, private institutions are becoming increasingly expensive, which could contribute to stress and mental health deficiencies that could affect grades and therefore job opportunities. For this study, we could use median income as an outcome variable and use institution ownership and median family income as predictor variables, building regression models trying to determine how median family income and institution type affect the earnings of a student following graduation.
